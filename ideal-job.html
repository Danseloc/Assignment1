<p>My Ideal job is Research Scientist at OpenAI - Codex. In this position I would be 
    in a team of code generators who develop AI programmers which write, debug and 
    improve computer programs. I would be working closely on aspects of machine learning 
    such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Training models, which aims to minimise the loss of a prediction by determining value, weight and bias from examples. </li>
    <li>Aligning models, which is the idea of setting rules and principles for AI to follow to, hopefully, instil a form of ethics on the model. </li>
    <li>Studying scaling laws, which are the functional relationship between two physical quantities. Understanding scaling laws is vital to increasing the potential of a model. </l1>
    <li>Running distributed reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is the practice of training machine learning models to sequentially make decisions. Distributed reinforcement learning becomes possible when several agents are involved in the reinforced learning. An agent in this case is AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this job appealing because of the fascinating 
    applications of the research that OpenAI conduct. Here are some 
    interesting things that OpenAI has developed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>GPT-3 -	an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.</li>
    <li>Codex - a model that parses natural language and generates code. This is used to power Github Copilot. </li>
    <li>DALL·E - an AI program that creates images from textual descriptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the current applications of research, OpenAI are 
    also looking to the future for areas of great interest and 
    concern, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting covert breakthrough AI systems by looking at things like the financial markets, news, and even online games.</li>
<li>Creating an agent that can win online programming competitions, i.e., a program that writes other programs.</li>
<li>Using AI to defend against malicious AI in future hack attempts.</li>
<li>long-term, highly complex simulation with multiple long-lived agents, with the goal of learning from each other, developing languages and accomplishing various goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>This position appeals to me because it is right at the forefront 
    of AI research, but more importantly it is rooted in an ethical 
    and progressive approach to AI development as per OpenAI’s mission 
    statement:</p>
<p><center><i>“OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”</i></center></p>
<p>This approach is especially important in the field of AI because of the immense potential impact of future and current breakthroughs on humanity.</p>
<p>To work in this role, I would need to be a confident and experienced programmer in python due to this being the primary language that OpenAI codes in, and fluent in multiple other languages such as JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and Swift. OpenAI state they look for candidates who have authored publications, worked on “impressive” projects, or a product. They are looking for a problem solver, a team player, and a hard worker. Having experience implementing deep learning algorithms is favoured, as well as experience in code generating models, symbolic reasoning systems and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>I currently possess no technical skills relevant to this job, but I am however a great team player, problem solver and hard worker. To achieve the technical skills and further my soft skills, I will complete a Bachelor of IT at RMIT majoring in machine learning, I have already started down this path. After the degree I will go on to do post graduate studies preferably a doctorate in machine learning with the goal of being first author on a publication.</p>

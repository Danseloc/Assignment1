<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! Thanks for the interest. I’m Daniel, I’m 32 and I live in Canberra. My passions include hiking, traveling, ancient history and gaming. My highest level of study so far is my year 12 certificate where I excelled in mathematics and biology. </p>
<h5><i>Fact:</i></h5>
<p><i>I’m terrified of open water but have swum with humpback whales in the Pacific Ocean and SCUBA-dove a shipwreck in the South China Sea. I was <i>always</i> looking over my shoulder for sharks</i></p>


<h1> Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I can’t honestly say when my interest in IT began, because 
    I can’t think of a time in my life where IT wasn’t intrinsic. 
    One of my formative childhood memories involves 
    6-year-old me holding the Nintendo gun (NES Zapper) 
    about one centimetre away from the convex glass TV screen, 
    feebly trying to shoot ducks out of the pixelated sky to 
    impress the ever-present dog (that game was truly ahead of its time). 
    In my adult years I've been building gaming PCs by following 
    YouTube tutorials and playing modern games with friends online 
    facilitated by various online communication applications. 
    Spending my entire life as a consumer and a dabbler has 
    instilled a desire to understand it all on a deeper level 
    (how did that NES Zapper kill those ducks? Magic?). 
    My natural curiosity has resulted in a passion for artificial 
    intelligence, I’m fascinated by the concept of AI and 
    automation, and am excited by the increasingly larger 
    role AI plays in modern society. I would love to be a 
    player in that expanding field.</p>
<h3><i>IT experience</i></h3>
<p>I have no formal training in IT, but I have proven indispensable 
    in professional environments due to my IT saturated upbringing. 
    I was frequently leaned on as the informal “IT guy” in previous 
    workplaces, usually to upload files to websites or troubleshoot 
    faulty peripheral hardware, and sometimes to turn the screen on. 
    I helped my current employer launch a successful small business 
    which now employs me. My role in the launch was to advise the 
    owner on which hardware to procure, to assist in the configuration 
    of the devices and software so they were ready for use, and then 
    finally to use the hardware and software in an ongoing daily basis 
    in a clinical setting. That business has been successful for over 
    a year now and I’m proud of this achievement.</p>
<h3><i>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</i></h3>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT because of their impressive reputation for 
    shaping highly employable graduates. During my studies at RMIT I 
    expect to learn; potential career paths in the IT industry, the 
    expectations of me as a professional in the IT industry, how to 
    be a valuable team asset, and a variety of coding languages. 
    After graduating, I hope to embark on a career path in the IT 
    industry, preferably in artificial intelligence. I want to have 
    a positive and progressive impact on society, and I believe 
    that a solid foundation in IT is an important first step towards 
    that goal.</p>

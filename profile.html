<p>I resulted in an <i>IRA</i> code, Investigative Realistic and Artistic. This test fed me into a website that went on to suggest job types for the <i>IRA</i> code.</p>

<h3><i>What I think of the results:</i></h3>
<p>I found these results to be revealing and confronting at times, particularly the Myers Briggs test. Apparently INFP-T only make up 4% of the population (and earn the least money) which was interesting to find out. I switch between INFP-T(turbulent) and INFP-A(assertive) depending on the environment I am in or how comfortable I am. I am absolutely introverted and introspective and value-based logic internal system, which came through in the test (76%). The LSI test results make sense to me as I certainly have an analytical brain and thrive when given structure and guidance. The RIASEC test follows the LSI test in pointing me towards analytical work roles. The latter two results almost contradict the Myer Briggs test results, which sits well with me. I feel like I have two brains, one dominated by emotions, and another dominated by logic. </p>
<h3><i>How I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team:</i></h3>
<p>In a team environment I am prone to internalise criticism and negatively reflect on it. I’m aware of this and have developed mechanisms to manage the response to the best of my ability. I would be very cautious of stepping on toes which sometimes makes it hard for me to give feedback, other side of this is that I am extremely unlikely to cause confrontations. I will add a level of acceptance and inclusion to a team, I can’t stand seeing anyone being treated unfairly. </p>
<h3><i>How I will take this into account when forming a team:</i></h3>
<p>My ideal position in a team would be as an assistant to the leader and as a mediator in conflict situations. I’d probably group well with an extrovert so someone can make tough decisions when they need to be made. I could keep them in check if I perceive them to be stepping on someone’s toes. I would do well with an assertive leader who has no problem giving me things to do.  </p>
